# Common SDLC Models

## Introduction

This presentation compares three popular Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models: Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps. We'll explore their characteristics, use cases, benefits, and limitations.

## Waterfall Model

* **Approach:** Linear, sequential. Each phase completes before the next begins.
    * Requirements -> Design -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance
* **Ideal for:**
    * Well-defined, stable requirements
    * Small to medium-sized projects
    * Industries with strict regulations
* **Benefits:**
    * Simplicity
    * Clear milestones
    * Thorough documentation
    * Predictable costs and schedules
* **Limitations:**
    * Inflexible to changes
    * Late testing
    * Unsuited for complex/evolving projects

---

## Agile Model

* **Approach:** Iterative and incremental. Focus on flexibility and customer collaboration.
* **Ideal for:**
    * Complex projects with changing requirements
    * High uncertainty
* **Benefits:**
    * Flexibility
    * Continuous feedback
    * Faster time-to-market
    * Improved quality
    * Strong customer collaboration
* **Limitations:**
    * Less predictable time and cost
    * Requires active stakeholder involvement
    * Challenging to manage in large teams

---

## DevOps Model

* **Approach:** Integrates development and IT operations for continuous delivery and automation.
* **Ideal for:**
    * Projects with frequent releases (e.g., web services, cloud applications)
    * Large-scale enterprises needing high availability and scalability
* **Benefits:**
    * Faster releases
    * Improved collaboration
    * Increased reliability and scalability
    * Enhanced security (DevSecOps)
* **Limitations:**
    * Complex implementation
    * Requires skilled personnel
    * Initial costs for tools and training

## Comparison Summary

| Aspect | Waterfall | Agile | DevOps |
|---|---|---|---|
| Approach | Linear, sequential | Iterative, incremental | Continuous, collaborative |
| Flexibility | Low | High | High |
| Risk Management | Low adaptability | Regular reassessment | Proactive through automation & monitoring |
| Customer Involvement | Limited | Continuous | Continuous |
| Time-to-Market | Longer | Shorter | Shortest |
| Documentation | Extensive | Minimal | Automation-focused |
| Suitable For | Fixed requirements | Evolving projects | Rapid, frequent releases |
| Best Practices | Clear phases, documentation | Iterative sprints, customer involvement | CI/CD, configuration management |

## Conclusion

Each SDLC model has its own strengths and weaknesses.  The best choice depends on:

* Specific project requirements
* Organizational needs
* Team dynamics

* **Waterfall:** Stable requirements
* **Agile:** Dynamic, evolving projects
* **DevOps:** Continuous deployment and operational efficiency
