# Slide 1: Title Slide
## Applying Beha2Vec with a Customer Data Platform (CDP)
### Building a 720° Customer View
**Subtitle:** Leveraging transformers and embeddings for advanced customer analysis

---

# Slide 2: Introduction
## What is Beha2Vec?
- A transformer-based approach to analyzing user behavior.
- Generates embeddings to represent users' behavioral patterns.
- Enables clustering, prediction, and actionable insights.

---

# Slide 3: Objective
## Building a 720° Customer View
- **360° View:** Traditional customer profiles (demographics, purchase history, etc.).
- **+360° Behavioral Dimension:** Behavioral insights through embeddings.
- Goal: Integrate both views into a unified **720° customer profile**.

---

# Slide 4: Why Combine CDP and Beha2Vec?
- CDPs aggregate structured customer data.
- Beha2Vec introduces behavioral vectors into the mix.
- Together:
  - **Structured data** from CDP.
  - **Behavioral patterns** via embeddings.

---

# Slide 5: Data Sources in CDP
## Examples of Integrated Data
1. Web and app interactions.
2. CRM data (emails, purchase history).
3. Loyalty programs and in-store activities.
4. Marketing campaign interactions.

---

# Slide 6: Benefits of a 720° View
1. **Personalization:** Highly targeted offers and recommendations.
2. **Predictive Analysis:** Anticipate customer needs.
3. **Behavioral Insights:** Understand unstructured patterns.
4. **Improved Segmentation:** Behavioral clustering for precision marketing.

---

# Slide 7: Methodology Overview
## Steps to Build the 720° View
1. Preprocess CDP data.
2. Train Beha2Vec embeddings on behavioral sequences.
3. Integrate embeddings into CDP.
4. Cluster customers and generate insights.

---

# Slide 8: Preprocessing CDP Data
## Preparing Data for Beha2Vec
- Filter relevant behavioral events (e.g., page views, purchases).
- Enrich data with metadata (e.g., themes, categories).
- Create sequential histories sorted by timestamp.

---

# Slide 9: Embedding Behavioral Patterns
## Training Beha2Vec Model
- Inputs: Event sequences from CDP.
- Transformer Architecture:
  - Self-attention for sequence relations.
  - Positional encoding for event order.
- Outputs: Dense vector embeddings for each customer.

---

# Slide 10: Cluster Analysis
## Grouping Customers Based on Embeddings
- Use K-Means or other clustering techniques.
- Insights from clusters:
  - Similar behaviors.
  - Engagement patterns.
  - Conversion likelihood.

---

# Slide 11: Visualizing Clusters
## Example Clusters
1. **Browsers:** High browsing, low purchase intent.
2. **Buyers:** Focused purchase patterns.
3. **Explorers:** Diverse browsing with specific intent.

---

# Slide 12: Integration into CDP
## Adding Behavioral Dimensions
1. Store embeddings as a feature in the CDP.
2. Link embeddings to structured customer data.
3. Enable query-based insights for marketing teams.

---

# Slide 13: Insights Generation
## Using Clusters for Actionable Insights
1. **Buyer Personas:** Create profiles for each cluster.
2. **Journey Mapping:** Track typical behaviors by segment.
3. **Campaign Design:** Tailor offers based on behavioral patterns.

---

# Slide 14: Use Case 1
## Predicting Churn
- Identify clusters with low engagement.
- Use embeddings to trace behavioral drop-offs.
- Design retention campaigns for at-risk customers.

---

# Slide 15: Use Case 2
## Upselling and Cross-Selling
- Identify purchase-focused clusters.
- Analyze vectors for potential cross-sell opportunities.
- Deliver personalized product recommendations.

---

# Slide 16: Chat-Driven Insights
## Interact with Data via Natural Language
- Use LLMs to query clusters directly.
- Example Queries:
  - "What drives purchases in Cluster 3?"
  - "Describe the browsing habits of Cluster 0 users."

---

# Slide 17: Challenges and Considerations
## Key Challenges
1. Data Quality: Inconsistent or missing events.
2. Model Generalization: Ensuring embeddings are broadly applicable.
3. Privacy Concerns: Secure handling of user data.

---

# Slide 18: Future Extensions
## Enhancing Beha2Vec with CDP
1. Incorporate real-time data streams.
2. Use advanced IDs (e.g., Hashed Emails).
3. Integrate with external ML pipelines for predictive tasks.

---

# Slide 19: Results and Impact
## Expected Outcomes
- Richer, actionable customer insights.
- Higher ROI on marketing efforts.
- Enhanced customer satisfaction via personalization.
