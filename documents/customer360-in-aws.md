## 🚀 **Enhanced System Architecture Explanation**

### ⚖️ **1. Scaling Layer (New Additions)**

1. **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**  
   - Distributes traffic evenly across ingestion services.  
   - Ensures no single Lambda function or Kinesis stream gets overwhelmed.

2. **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)**  
   - Fan-out model to distribute event data to multiple SQS queues or Kinesis streams.  
   - Handles massive spikes in events efficiently.

3. **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)**  
   - Buffers incoming events from SNS and ALB.  
   - Ensures no data loss even during peak traffic.  
   - Allows decoupling between event ingestion and processing layers.

---

### 🚀 **2. Ingestion Layer Enhancements**

- **AWS Kinesis:** Captures real-time events efficiently at scale.
- **AWS Lambda:** Processes data from SQS and Kinesis in parallel.
