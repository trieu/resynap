### ðŸ“š **20 Slides for Chapter 8: Data Types and Sources (Customer 360)**

---

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Data Types and Sources**
- Data is the foundation of Customer 360.
- Chapter focuses on:
   - Types of customer data.
   - Data sources that power Customer 360.
   - Importance of data organization and accessibility.

### **Slide 2: Evolution of Data Types**
- Data has evolved from simple numeric and text-based formats to complex multimedia and real-time streams.
- By 2025, global data volume is expected to reach **175 zettabytes**.
- Growth in **semi-structured data** due to meta-tagging in documents, videos, and images.

---

### **Slide 3: Three Main Data Types**
1. **Structured Data:** Highly organized, fits into relational databases.
2. **Unstructured Data:** Raw data like images, videos, text.
3. **Semi-Structured Data:** Combination of structured and unstructured data, e.g., tagged emails.

### **Slide 4: Key Characteristics of Data Types**
| **Data Type**    | **Storage**       | **Analysis**  | **Access**       |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Structured       | Relational DBs    | Quantitative | Easy (SQL)       |
| Unstructured     | NoSQL, Data Lakes | Qualitative  | Advanced NLP, AI |
| Semi-Structured  | Hybrid Models     | Both         | Custom Parsing  |

- Organizations deal with all three types, but semi-structured data is the fastest-growing category.
